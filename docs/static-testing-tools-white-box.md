# Static Testing Tools & White-box test Design
This section covers static testing tools, white-box test design, code coverage and their contribution to our project.

## Static Testing Tools:

### **[SonarQube](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/kea-1semester/projects)**
To ensure code quality, we chose to use SonarQube as our primary static testing tool.
SonarQube allows us to identify potential bugs, security risks, code smells, and violations of coding standards before running the application. 

By analyzince the codebase statically, we gain insight into areas that require refactoring or further attention, which helps to imporve the overall maintainability and structure of our backend. 

#### Usage:

### **[ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)**

<small>_Although ReSharper is and IDE-based tool and therefore not part of our official static testing tools for this section, it was stiill used by some of us as a supplementary aid during development_</small>

ReSharper provides on-the-fly code inspections, refactoring suggestions and quick fixes directly inside the editor. Its feedback helped identify minor issues such as unused variables, inconsistant naming, missing null-checks, and oppotunities for simplyfying expressions.
